                    <div p>
                        Every year, Walt Disney Imagineering holds a contest where students may create a new concept location based on the competition’s theme. I spent a little over 2 months working with three imaginative people, Amberly, Connie, and Jorenne, to create something of our own to submit. Stellarium is a revision of the abandoned Starlight Bowl in Balboa Park, San Diego. 
                    </div><br>
                    
                    <h3><u>Team and your Role</u></h3>
                    <div p>
                        My team consisted entirely of four UC San Diego Cognitive Science students with specializations in Human-Computer Interaction. We were lacking in diversity of expertise but that did not deter us from trying out something new. Though we all came from HCI backgrounds, we had different artistic interests that allowed us to each put in our own input. Amberly was into animation, Connie was into sketching and design, Jorenne was into 3-D modelling, and I was into digital art through tablet.

                    <h3><u>The Work</u></h3>
                    <div p>
                        The theme of competition for this year was abandoned places. The prompt was to pick an abandoned area and reimagine it into something presentable and visitable for guests. 
                        <br>
                        The first week was dedicated finding what different locations we could possibly use to renovate and remake. 
                        We compiled a list of various areas but settled on a place near and dear to our hearts: the abandoned Starlight Bowl amphitheater in Balboa Park in our city of San Diego. 
                        <br>
                        After we decided on a place, we started to brainstorm on potential ways of remaking the amphitheatre while still retaining its authenticity. 
                        <br>
                        We decided on a concept that focused on biodiversity by including features that allowed guests to immerse themselves within nature
                        <ul style="square">
                            <li>
                                <strong>Amphitheatre:</strong> To appeal to the roots of the structure, we kept the old theater but took out the back to have an open-air structure. The back leads to a garden maze.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Starlight Tree:</strong> A tree that symbolizes friendship and relationship between humans and their surrounding nature. It is found within the center of a winding maze. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Star pods:</strong> A comfortable pod that showcases the constellations at night through projection onto the ceiling.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Terrarium Pods:</strong> Inspired by terrarium glasses, the terrarium pod hangs on a tree as a relaxing seat for guests. The seat wraps around the person allowing an emmersing way to observe nature. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        I focused on the conceptual sketches and digitization of the artwork. It was my first time working with a tablet as I usually work with traditional media. There was a steeper learning curve than I had expected, and the final work was not as satisfactory as I would have hoped.
                        <br>
                        Nevertheless, I have gained a deeper profound respect for artists who work digital media and the efforts they go through to accomplish their work.

                    <h3><u>Results</u></h3>
                    <div p>
                        Though we did not reach finals, our team worked endlessly on producing a new concept from scratch and are proud of our final deliverables. 
                        For most of us, we delved into a new form of art-making and storytelling that was unfamiliar. We learned a great deal from the experience in terms of project management and concept visualization.
