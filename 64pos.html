                    <h3><u>Project Background</u></h3>
                    <div p>
                        Over the summer, I was referred by my friend to a small start-up, 64 POS, to work as an UX intern. Though I joined late and had only worked for about a month, I was able to get some hands-on experience with working on user experience concepts for real users. The particular project I worked on was developing a web aggregator mobile web-app.

                    <h3><u>Team and your Role</u></h3>
                    <div p>
                        I was taken in as a UX intern where I had the opportunity to develop analysis and technical skills necessary to fully understand and develop for users. My team had a few other UX interns, software developers, and a project manager to help manage the process.

                    <h3><u>The Work</u></h3>
                    <div p>
                        Some of the work I was given inlcuded:
                        <ul style="square">
                            <li>Performing competitor analysis research and point of view analysis to find user needs. Used several news apps to find what UI/UX functionalities were common and distinguished from there which ones were necessary.</li>
                            <li>Creating wireframe mockups for some screens based on workflow chart. The UI was based on several other apps and what features were deemed important in our team.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <!-- wireframes -->
                        <div class=" col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-2">
                            <img src="img/article-comment-wireframe.png" class="img-responsive"  onclick="openModal();showSlides(1)" class="cursor" alt="Wireframe 1">

                    </div><br>
                    
                    <h3><u>Results</u></h3>
                    <div p>
                        I learned more about the process behind user experience and how teams of designers work with each other. The experience, though brief, had value in learning more about the workings of a designer.
