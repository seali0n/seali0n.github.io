                    <h3><u>Project Background</u></h3>
                    <div p>
                        I joined SASE, a pre-professional organization, to develop my professional and soft skills. I applied to be on board as publicity intern my first year and now work as the publicity officer currently.
                        <br>
                        Being on board has really allowed me to learn important qualities, such as teamwork and leadership,  that would be useful and vital in the industry world.
                    </div>

                    <h3><u>Team and your Role:</u></h3>
                    <div p>
                        As someone with two years of public relations, I can say that the job has no break and has a constant stream of work.
                        I coordinated with the social chairs to create flyers and event pages for future social events.
                        I worked with the external president to create flyers and sponsorship packages to inform companies of our annual professional event, Dining with Professionals.
                        I collaborated with outreach chair to spread our professional events to other on-campus organizations and local high schools.
                        <br>
                        Every year, SASE hosts Dining with Professional, an event that brings in several working professionals from local San Diego companies to come dine with UC San Diego undergraduates and local high school students. This opportunity allows students to learn more about the daily working lives of full-time employees and understand the different paths people have taken in order to pursue their careers.  As Publicity Committee lead, I was in charge of publicizing the event to the student body as well as creating any necessary printings for the event.

                    <div p>
                        We definitely had a spurt of growth in terms of registration from last year to this year. Our event brought around 100 people together. 
                        <br>The number exceeded our expectations and we were stressed out during the event as we tried to handle the behind the scenes and make sure the event ran as smoothly as possible. Though tired, we were very proud and happy on the success and what hopeful future our org would have. Definitely a worthwhile experience to see everything you worked so hard on come to life and fruition!

                    <h3><u>What You Would Have Done Differently</u></h3>
                    <div p>
                        Being on board of a dedicated organization while balancing academic life will always be a struggle.
                        I would not say that the entire experience had been all positives with no setbacks.
                        But I definitely did grow a lot professionally, socially, mentally, and emotionally. <br>
                        I would say that SASE did help me get more hands-on experience with working together with people, communicating needs properly and effectively, and designing visual publications, something that I have been wanting to do for a while.
                        I joined on my own and was forced to grow to keep up. It was challenging and at times, vastly stressful, but having a supportive board helps keep the moral up. For that, I am extremely grateful for all that SASE has given me.
