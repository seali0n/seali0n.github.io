					<p> Over three months, my group and I had an opportunity to work on any problem that could be solved based on supportive evidence. My team and I wanted to focus on a  sustainability problem, originally looking into product waste. Given some thought and time, we eventually decided to venture out into a more abstract concept: time waste. We then went through the process of needfinding and conducting user research.

It turns out that  there are countless factors that affect attention span and productivity levels. We focused on technology-related data because we felt that everybody was affected either directly or indirectly by phone usage. Our main takeaways were:

                        Based on our research, we found many students were often on their phones in class. Though professors do notice phone distractions (despite the class size), they do not take any action to discourage usage as it would take away lecture time. Thus, there is a prevailing issue of irrelevant phone use in class lectures that is not properly addressed. What can we do to solve it?

Though we gained a lot of good input, there were some limitations that affected our designs. Because of constraints, we were only able to test people within the UC San Diego campus who fall under the WEIRD category of demographics. We also did not test over a long period of time so we do not know about long-term effectiveness.<br><br>

                <div class="col-10 col-sm-8">Personally, I do like the amount of freedom users get when customizing their experience more. I think while Focus Mode is more of a generalized experience to the productivity problem, Screen Time gives more of a tailored experience which I like a lot. The feature also gives a report of the user’s phone usage throughout the day which aligns with Focus Mode’s purpose of allowing the user to gain better self-awareness of their activities. I think UX design in mindfulness regarding technology use will trend as more companies become aware of the growing need users have for positive productivity. </div>
